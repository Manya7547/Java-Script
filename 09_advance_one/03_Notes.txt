Promise object 
- It represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning 
  the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A Promise is in one of these states:
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
- it is used to perform asynchronous operations more effectively
- They provide a cleaner, more readable, and more manageable way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.
