XMLHttpRequest:
- also called XHR
- JavaScript object that provides a way to interact with servers via HTTP. 
- It allows web pages to make asynchronous requests to a server, receive data, and update the web page without requiring a full page reload.
- This is the foundation of Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
- HTTP Methods: Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods.
- Response Types: Can handle various types of data including text, JSON, XML, and more.

Key Points about XMLHttpRequest object: 
- Creating the Request: new XMLHttpRequest() creates an XMLHttpRequest object.
- Configuring the Request: xhr.open(method, URL, async) initializes the request with the desired HTTP method and URL. 
The third parameter (async) specifies whether the request should be asynchronous (true by default).
- Sending the Request: xhr.send() sends the request to the server.
- the instance is also called an ajax object.
- Handling the Response:
xhr.onload: Fired when the request completes successfully.
xhr.onerror: Fired if the request fails due to network issues

XMLHttpRequest.readyState
- provides the current state of the request. It can have one of five values, indicating the progress of the request.

readyState Values
0 (UNSENT):
The XMLHttpRequest object has been created, but the open() method hasn't been called yet.
1 (OPENED):
The open() method has been called, but the send() method hasn't been called yet.
2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED):
The send() method has been called, and the response headers and status are available.
3 (LOADING):
The response is being downloaded; responseText holds partial data.
4 (DONE):
The request is complete, and the response is fully received.
