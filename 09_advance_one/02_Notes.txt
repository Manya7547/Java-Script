What is V8?
V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is used in the Google Chrome browser and the Node.js runtime.
Purpose:
The V8 engine compiles JavaScript directly into native machine code before executing it, which improves performance and execution speed.
Key Features:

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: V8 compiles JavaScript to native code at runtime, rather than interpreting it, which speeds up execution.
Garbage Collection: Automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused memory.
Optimization: V8 includes various optimization techniques to improve the performance of JavaScript execution.
Usage:

Google Chrome: V8 powers JavaScript execution in Chrome.
Node.js: V8 is used in Node.js to execute JavaScript code on the server side.

console.log()
Purpose:

console.log() is a method provided by the browser’s console object or Node.js that outputs messages to the web console. It's commonly used for debugging purposes.
Part of Core JavaScript?:

No, it's not part of the core JavaScript language. Instead, it is part of the environment-specific features provided by the browser or runtime (e.g., browser console or Node.js).
Browser Console: In web browsers, console.log() is provided by the browser’s JavaScript engine.
Node.js: In Node.js, console.log() is part of the Node.js runtime's global object.
Usage:

Debugging: Helps developers understand what’s happening in their code by printing variable values, execution flow, and other messages.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('Hello, World!');
console.log('The value of x is:', x);
Other Console Methods:

console.error(): Outputs error messages.
console.warn(): Outputs warnings.
console.info(): Outputs informational messages.
console.table(): Displays data as a table.
